                <h2>January brings us Firefox</h2>
                <p>One Monday afternoon, Mike, adopting a very unusual style, wore a hoody. Nobody would ever think of wearing a hoody on a very hot day. His friends also wondered why he was being weird. They became a little aloof with Mike that day. The next day, Mike wore a hoody again, this time of a different color. This went on every day for a week and his friends gradually got used to it.</p>
